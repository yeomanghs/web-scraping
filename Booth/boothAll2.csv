"The VesprSolar V-Clamp makes installing a solar panel as easy as changing a lightbulb.  It is a spring-based fastener for fast, secure attachment of PV modules to trackers and fixed tilt ground mount arrays. Construction teams can consistently install PV modules in under 30 seconds with the V-Clamp, saving weeks in installation time for large projects.The V-Clamp’s torque-free locking mechanism prevents panel loosening from vibration and is designed to increase the long-term storm resiliency of PV arrays. It requires no power tools, installing perfectly every time using just a simple pair of locking pliers.

About Roller Die + Forming
Roller Die + Forming is a 78 year custom roll former supplying a unique combination of complex profiles as well as standard shapes. Over many years we have built a library of standard sections some 1200+ strong available FREE for any customer's use. These tools can be complimented by custom designed &amp; built pre-punch dies from RDF's in-house tool room to provide any hole &amp; slot configuration. Many solar customers have relished the low entry cost of converting to roll formed shapes or redesigning an existing system using RDF's portfolio of standard shapes. Speed to market with an improved product is additional benefit, without the long lead time for custom design and build. RDF has an outstanding proven pre-galvanized supply chain with one of our mill sources located 73 miles from our Louisville flagship plant offering grades up to 80 min yield and G-235 coatings. For ASTM A123A applications we utilize 2 galvanizers strategically positioned 5 and 95 miles from our Louisville facility
